MSVC Linkage issues and potential runtime suprises:

Some dependencies (freetype.lib to name one) have been compiled in debug mode (linked with MSVCRTD; the debug MSVC C runtime).
It clashes (in the form of the warning LNK4098) when trying to link a Release build of Lums (which uses the non-debug CRT: MSVCRT).
A short web search (SO questions) yielded that it may cause weird / unpredicable runtime problems.

Compilation and linkage directives of a lib file can easily be determined by running Visual Studio's ``dumpbin /DIRECTIVES'' command on the .lib  and search (for this purpose) for ''/DEFAULTLIB:'' strings (there's one for each object).
